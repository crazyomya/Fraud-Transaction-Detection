# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is dedicated to developing a machine learning-based fraud detection system. Its primary aim is to identify and highlight fraudulent transactions within a dataset consisting of transaction details, such as original balance, new balance, and time. The project encompasses extensive data analysis, preprocessing, and the creation of a predictive model. Remarkably, the Random Forest classifier has proven to be the most effective in highlighting fraudulent transactions.

## Project Highlights

1. **Data Collection**: The project begins by collecting a dataset containing various transaction details, including original balance, new balance, and timestamps.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data is thoroughly cleaned, missing values are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are scaled for analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to uncover insights into the distribution and characteristics of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features are engineered or modified to enhance the model's capacity to flag fraudulent transactions.

5. **Model Building**: Multiple machine learning models are trained and assessed for their predictive capabilities. Notably, the Random Forest classifier consistently outperforms other models.

6. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7. **Fraud Detection**: The project's main highlight is its ability to flag and highlight transactions classified as fraudulent.
